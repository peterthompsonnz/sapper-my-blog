<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>This site is built using Svelte/Sapper. Basically, I built it to learn how to use Sapper.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Peter Thompson. Programming is a passion of mine. I have been doing it since the late 1990s. For a start I learned C and C++ - this was in the first year of my Bachelor of Information Technology degree. In my spare time I taught myself JavaScript and HTML so I could make my daughter games with some sort of a GUI. You can't really do this using C. In the later years of my degree I learned Java, VBA, PHP and SQL. Currently I mainly program using JavaScript and also dabble in C, C++, Java and Python.</p>
