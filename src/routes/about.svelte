<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>The name of this site is <strong>Happy Duckies</strong>. This is a totally random name that I thought up when I found on <strong>unsplash</strong> the duckies image that is displayed on the home page. Every homepage has to have some sort of an image - right? The fact that I chose one that has nothing to do with the content of the site is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>The site is built using <strong>Svelte/Sapper</strong>. I built it to learn how to use Sapper and also to host some of the programs that I have made over the years.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My Web nom de plume varies. On <strong>repl.it</strong> it is <strong>Malvoliothegood</strong>. Malvolio was a minor Shakespearean character. Of course Malvolio is not my real name, but it's best to be careful about what information about yourself you publish on the web.</p>

<p>Programming is a passion of mine. I have been practising it since the late 1990s. The first languages I learned where C and C++. This was during the first year of my Bachelor of Information Technology degree. In my spare time I taught myself JavaScript and HTML so I could make my daughter games with some sort of a GUI - C and C++ don't have much of a one. In later years of my degree I learned: Java, VBA, PHP and SQL. Currently I mainly program using JavaScript and also dabble in C, C++, Java and Python.</p>
